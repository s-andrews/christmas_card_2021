# Babraham Bioinformatics Christmas Card 2021

Every year the bioinformatics group tries to come up with an interesting a relevant idea for our christmas card.

The idea here is that we're going to build a machine learning model which will be able to distinguish pictures of people in the group from pictures of their christmas trees.  Not the toughest image recognition task in the world, but it's the thought that counts :-)
